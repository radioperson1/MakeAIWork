# MakeAIWork

## Projects

This repository contains sources to be used by python students. Directory <i>project</i> contains the (re)sources:
<ul>
<li>p1, p2 and p3</i> containing
<i>cursus_materiaal</i> with a project description
<li>notebooks</li> containing Jupyter notebooks for reference
<li>scripts</li> with some example Python scripts 
</ul>

## Python AI Workspace

Students use a containerised Python environment running a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image. 

### Files available to the container
The project files are accessible in the containerised runtime environment by means of a bind mount:
```sh
${hostdir_project}:${containerdir_project}
 ```
causing directory <i>project</i> on your laptop to be mounted to <i>/project</i> at the container.
<br>

***CAUTION
You can remove both container and image without data loss but be aware that files removed from the container directory /project will also be removed from you host directory project.

### Start a Python container
Python can run in different modi:
<ul>

<li>
<b>REPL</b> (Read Evaluate Print Loop) modus to experimentally learn Python commands. Exit by pressing [Control+D].

```bash 
./python.sh
```
</li>

<li>
Start python with a <b>script</b> from directory <i>project</i>

```bash 
./python.sh scripts/lists/sum.py
```
</li>
Start <b>Jupyter Server</b> to learn from the <i>notebooks</i> available at <i>project/notebooks</i>

```bash 
./jupyter.sh
```
<li>
Start container with an interactive <b>bash</b> (expert mode) to perform system operations

```sh
./bash.sh
```

### Docker artifacts
Each of the above scripts will call run/miw_container.sh which will spin up a container based on the latest version of 'jaboo/miw' which is either stored locally or will be fetched from available at [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jaboo/miw). 

Inspect locally stored images with
```sh
docker images
```

The containers will be removed automatically after being terminated. For overview of both running and terminated containers enter  
```sh
docker container
```

</li>

</ul>

### Removing Docker artifacts
Docker images and containers can be removed (if not done automatically) by running
```sh
run/clean_docker_artifacts.sh
```

***NOTE
Removing images and/containers will not cause data loss. After removing the image, Docker will pull a new instance when you start a container.

## Installation

### Git
Download and install [Git for Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.36.1.windows.1/Git-2.36.1-64-bit.exe).

Copy public key to git

### Windows Subsystem for Linux 
To be able to use Docker, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) needs to be activated. This can be done by running the following commands in <b>Powershell</b>. 

Enable WSL2
```pwsh
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
```

 Enable the Virtual Machine Platform feature
```pwsh
dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```

Make WSL 2 Default
```pwsh
wsl –set-default-version 2
```

### Docker
Download and install [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)<br>
Check if you are able to use Docker by running the following in <b>Git Bash</b>
```sh
docker run hello-world
```
