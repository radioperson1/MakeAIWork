### Install Docker Desktop (Windows and MacOS)
To facilitate you with a managed portable [isolated](https://learndocker.online/introduction/the-whats-and-whys/what-are-containers/) [Development Environment]((https://learndocker.online/introduction/the-whats-and-whys/why-docker-for-devs)), we provide a Docker image in which all dependencies are preinstalled. We prefer Docker for isolation since it is a much lighter solution than [Virtual Machine](https://learndocker.online/introduction/the-whats-and-whys/containers-vs-vms/). 

<ol>

<li>

**Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started)**

[Download for Mac with Apple M* chip](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/apple-silicon/)

<li>

**Configure Docker Desktop**

Open Docker Desktop, go to settings and select <i>Start when you login</i>

In Windows you can a script to enable Docker Desktop to start directly after you start Git Bash:

```bash
sh/git_bash_profile.sh
```

this script will also navigate automatically to the MakeAIWork directory.

</li>

<li>

**Test your Docker installation**
Check if you are able to use Docker by running an example container in <b>(git) bash</b>
```sh
docker run hello-world
```

If that works, you can run the scripts to start the Docker container as described in section <u>Python AI Workspace Usage</u>.

</li>

<li>

**Install python to enable the webbrowser to open automatically after starting a webservice**

<ol>

<li>

Install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3105/)

</li>

<li>

Install venv (Ubuntu)

```sh
sudo apt install python3.10-venv
```

</li>

<li>

Create virtual Python environment

```sh
python3 -m venv .
```

</li>

<li>

Activate venv
```sh
source bin/activate
```
</li>

</ol>

***NOTE***
We only run Python directly on the host to sue the webbrowser module. For ad Docker Workaround on Windows, you need to install the Ubuntu in Windows sub-system.

</li>

</li>

</ol>

### Edit with Visual Studio Code
<ol>

<li>

Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)

</li>

<li>

**Enable VSCode to be opened from the command line (macOS only)**

In VSCode, open the Command Palette and type 'shell command' in order to select the Shell command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH

</li>

<li>

**Start vscode with command from current directory**

Start a (git) bash shell and enter directory MakeAIWork, from there use the command <i>code</i> to start vscode.
```sh
cd MakeAIWork
code .
```

</li>

<li>

**Install the [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)**

</li>

<li>

**Install Live Share**

Follow the instructions at [Collaborate with Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share)

</li>

</ol>

## Run Python scripts with Graphical UI in Docker (MacOS only)

<ol>

<li>

**Install XQuartz X.Org Window System**
On the MacOS host, we use xquartz to provide us with a MacOS X Window System.<br>
Download and install [xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)<br>
Log out and Log in to activate the changes the terminal

</li>

<li>

**Configure XQuartz to allow network connections from host**

<ol>

<li>

Get your IP address

Run the following command in the terminal to see your IP address

```bash
ifconfig en0 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'
```

<li>

Start XQuartz

```bash
open -a XQuartz
```

which will open a XQuartz terminal in which you enter

```sh
xhost {Your IP}
```

Click on the word 'XQuartz' on the top left of your screen (next to the Apple logo) and select <i>Preference</i>. Open the tab 
<i>Security</i> and check 'Allow connections from network clients' 

</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>

**Install Socat**
The graphical Python script runs with a Linux X Window System in a Docker container. To connect this to the MacOS X Window System on the host we use the [command line utility socat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/socat). 

```bash
brew install socat
```

</li>

<li>

**Test by running a Python script with GUI**

</li>

</ol>

### Ubuntu in Windows sub-system (alternative for Windows users)
Instead of Git bash and Docker, you can install a complete Ubuntu terminal environment with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Although Ubuntu can be installed in minutes, you lack the benefit of all preinstalled Python modules in an isolated container. 

<ol>

<li>

Download and install [Ubuntu LTS on WSL2](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#3-download-ubuntu)

</li>

<li>

Install Miniconda

</li>

<li>

Install dependencies

</li>

<li>

Install Jupyterlab

</li>

</ol>

## Python AI Workspace Usage
Students use a containerised Python environment running a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image. 

### Files available to the container
The project files are accessible in the containerised runtime environment by means of a bind mount between the current (host)directory project and/or notebooks on your laptop and <i>/home/student/project</i> and/or <i>/home/student/nontebooks</i> at the container instance.
<br>

***CAUTION***
<br>
You can remove both container and image without data loss but be aware that files removed from the container directory /project will also be removed from you host directory project.
<br>

### Start a Python container
Docker scripts can be found in <i>docker</i>. Each of the scripts below will call <i>docker/run/miw_container.sh</i> to facilitate the following runtimes:

<ul>

<li>

<b>REPL</b> (Read Evaluate Print Loop) modus to experimentally learn Python commands. Exit by pressing [Control+D].

```bash 
sh/python.sh
```

</li>

<li>

Start python with a <b>script</b> from directory <i>project</i>

```bash 
sh/python.sh scripts/lists/sum.py
```

</li>

<li>

Start <b>Jupyter Lab</b> to learn from the <i>notebooks</i> available at <i>project/notebooks</i>

```bash 
sh/jupyter.sh
```

</li>

<li>

Start container with an interactive <b>bash</b> (expert mode) to perform system operations

```sh
sh/bash.sh
```  

</li>

</ul>
  
### Docker artifacts
Each of the above scripts will call run/miw_container.sh which will spin up a container based on the latest version of 'jaboo/miw' which is either stored locally or will be fetched from available at [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/jaboo/miw). 

Inspect locally stored images with
```sh
docker images
```

The containers will be removed automatically after being terminated. For overview of both running and terminated containers enter  
```sh
docker container ls -a
```

Removing images and/containers will not cause data loss. After removing the image, Docker will pull a new instance when you start a container. 
Docker images and containers can be removed (if not done automatically) by running
```sh
docker/clean_docker_artifacts.sh
```
